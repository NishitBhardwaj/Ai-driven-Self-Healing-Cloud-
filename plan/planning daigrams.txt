1. System Architecture UML Diagram (Component Diagram)

This diagram represents the major components of the system and how they interact with each other.
Explanation:

User Interaction Agent: Handles user requests and interactions.

Task-Solving Agent: Solves tasks assigned by the user or other agents.

Self-Healing Agent: Detects failures and recovers cloud resources.

Scaling Agent: Scales resources up or down based on load.

Security Agent: Monitors security and compliance.

Performance Monitoring Agent: Tracks system performance and health.

Optimization Agent: Ensures efficient use of resources.

Database: Stores logs, agent activity data, user interactions.

2. Agent Communication UML Diagram (Sequence Diagram)

This diagram shows the sequence of interactions between agents when a user submits a request for scaling resources.

User -> User Interaction Agent: Submit scaling request
User Interaction Agent -> Task-Solving Agent: Forward request for scaling
Task-Solving Agent -> Scaling Agent: Delegate request to scale resources
Scaling Agent -> Cloud Resources (e.g., EC2, Lambda): Scale up resources
Scaling Agent -> Task-Solving Agent: Confirm scaling completed
Task-Solving Agent -> User Interaction Agent: Notify user of scaling success
User Interaction Agent -> User: Display scaling confirmation


Explanation:

The User initiates a request through the User Interaction Agent.

The User Interaction Agent forwards the request to the Task-Solving Agent, which then delegates the task to the Scaling Agent.

The Scaling Agent interacts with cloud resources to scale up the system and confirms the action.

The task completion is communicated back to the user.

3. Self-Healing Process UML Diagram (Activity Diagram)

This diagram shows the flow of activities when the Self-Healing Agent detects a failure


Start
   |
   v
[Monitor system health]
   |
   v
[Failure detected?] -- No --> [Continue monitoring]
   |
   v
[Yes]
   |
   v
[Check backup resources]
   |
   v
[Restart failed service]
   |
   v
[Verify recovery] -- No --> [Retry recovery]
   |
   v
[Yes]
   |
   v
[Notify User of Recovery]
   |
   v
End



Explanation:

The Self-Healing Agent constantly monitors the system for failures.

Upon detecting a failure, it checks backup resources, restarts services, and verifies recovery.

If recovery fails, it retries. Once recovery is successful, the Self-Healing Agent notifies the user.

4. Agent Interaction UML Diagram (Class Diagram)

This diagram shows the classes (agents) and their relationships, especially focusing on how agents communicate with each other and the system.

|----------------------------|          |---------------------------|
| + monitorPerformance()      |          | + detectSecurityBreach()  |
| + optimizeResources()       |          | + protectResources()      |
+----------------------------+          +---------------------------+





Explanation:

User Interaction Agent communicates with the Task-Solving Agent to handle user requests.

Self-Healing Agent and Scaling Agent work together for system recovery and resource management.

Performance Monitoring Agent tracks the system's performance and collaborates with the Security Agent for threat detection and mitigation.

5. Cloud Interaction UML Diagram (Component Diagram)

This diagram shows how the agents interact with the cloud resources (e.g., EC2, S3) and other services.

                            +---------------------------+        +---------------------+
                                         |

                            +---------------------------+



Explanation:

User Interface (React/Node.js) communicates with the User Interaction Agent.

The Task-Solving Agent interacts with the Scaling Agent and cloud resources like EC2, Lambda, and S3.

The Self-Healing Agent monitors the health of resources and interacts with the cloud to initiate recovery actions.

6. CI/CD Pipeline UML Diagram (Component Diagram)

This diagram represents the components of the CI/CD pipeline and how they interact to build, test, and deploy the agents.

                                                 |
                                                 v
                                       +------------------------+
                                       |   Cloud Deployment     |
                                       |   (AWS, GCP, Azure)    |
                                       +------------------------+



Explanation:

Code is pushed to a GitHub/GitLab repository.

The CI/CD Pipeline (e.g., Jenkins or GitLab CI) automatically builds, tests, and deploys Docker containers to Kubernetes (local or cloud).

Docker images are pushed to a Docker registry (e.g., Docker Hub, AWS ECR), and once they pass the tests, they are deployed to staging or production environments.
